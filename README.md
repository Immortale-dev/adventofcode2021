# Advent of Code 2021
C++ solutions for AOC 2021 event

## Build and Run
you can build solutions for each day using any c++ compiler version at least 14. And then just pipe your input to the input buffer.

***Example:***
```bash
cd d12
g++ -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp
./a.exe < input.txt
```

## Days
* ✅**Day 1:** Simple _constructive_ problem.
* ✅**Day 2:** Simple _constructive_ problem. Not harder then the first one.
* ✅**Day 3:** _Constructive_ problem + bit operations.
* ✅**Day 4:** _Constructive_ problem could be optimized to work faster, but the input is small enough for the _brute force_.
* ✅**Day 5:** _Constructive_ problem. Input size is small enough to build a grid and fill it with numbers.
